Part 2:
Grade: 1/2
Comments: I didn't receive a project part 1 (proposal) from you, so I'm not 
entirely sure what type of data you are using and what type of prediction
you want to build a classifier to make. For the project, you will need to 
have a main dataset and then another data set that can supplement the main
one. The idea being that you would combine the two (using the combine) 
function to create a large (wider) dataset. For this part, I was looking
for information on what features you plan to use for building classifiers
and some justification/explanation for why you would use them. This should 
also be accompanied with multiple data visualizations. 

Part 3: 
Grade: 2/2 
Comments: I'm a bit confused on what the goal of your project is and what 
exactly it is you are trying to predict here. I think it would be better to
focus on trying to predict a future match outcome (win/lose, set win/loss result)
than looking at each individual statistic (I'm not sure what this is trying
to do exactly).
